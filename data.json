[{"author": "Not_Han_Solo", "body": "Oh, honey. Honey, honey. It's going to be all right.\n\nFirst thing's first: you can do whatever you want to do, whenever you want to do it. If that means never transitioning, that's fine. If that means being a girl at home, but not in public, that's fine too. Transition is like a train--there are a million different stops, and you can get on and off wherever and whenever you want to. You can take the express line or the scenic route. **There's no wrong way to be trans**.\n\nLet me address some of your worries, one by one:\n\n* Tall girls exist, and are amazing. I'm 6' tall myself. But set that aside--[this is one of my dear friends](https://imgur.com/a/Se2y9rj). She's 6'3\", if I recall correctly, and is an absolute *goddess*. [She's also trans](https://imgur.com/a/B3WMAjy). I defy you to claim that she doesn't pass--she's one of the most beautiful women I've ever met.\n* Not wanting to stand out--wanting to disappear into the background--is probably dysphoria, honey. It's a desire to annihilate the parts of yourself that you can't stand. *And it'll probably get worse as you age*. If you haven't already, sit down and read through genderdysphoria.fyi.\n* The mantra you hear a lot is that passing isn't everything. It's not. But I sure as hell want to pass too. I've only been on this train for six months, and only on HRT for four months. I'm 35, so HRT is dramatically less effective on me than it'd be on you. My face was *far* more masculine than yours is. **[Thing is, HRT is absolute witchcraft](https://imgur.com/a/z2TH9f1).** Being 100% stealth was never an option for me because of how public my job makes me, and I'm older, so I'd kind of given up on the hope of ever passing. Thing is, I haven't *not* passed since mid-November.\n* Low voices suck. I have one. *[But you can change that, with hard work and diligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2txYhkmhVts)*. That video is of someone who taught themselves; if you want faster, better results, a speech pathologist can help you make huge strides in a much shorter period of time. I'm still early on in my voice training--session 2 of 12--and I've already migrated from a 140hz pitch to a 148hz pitch, with only a month's work. 160hz is the lower end of feminine range, and 180hz is definitively feminine. My speech pathologist is 100% confident I'll get there, and be able to comfortably maintain the voice all day for 8 hour teaching days. She says the only people she's worked with who haven't made it are the ones who had to stop because money or something.\n* This last bullet point is the most important one, so I want you to read it, and then read it again, OK? **Even if my transition had been a disaster--even if I'd been rejected by my friends and family, lost my job, and hadn't gotten such amazing results from HRT, I'd do it again in a heartbeat, because the last six months have been, by far, the happiest of my life.** The worst part in all of this is that it took me so long to realize who I am, and that I wasted so much of my life feeling awful. That feeling is pretty universal amongst us later-in-life folx. The reason I note this is to ask you a frank question: will you be able to be happy--*happy*--pretending to be someone else for the next five years? Ten? Fifteen?\n\nBeing trans is hard. It's scary. **But it's also incredibly joyous**. Only you can know what's right for you, and when it's right to do those things. I definitely won't pressure you, and neither should anyone else. Just know--*know*--that you're part of the community whether you transition or not. You are welcome here. And, if and when you choose to transition, you won't have to go it alone. Nobody should.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you need or want to talk, ok?"}, {"author": "Nobodyknowsmynewname", "body": "Girl, I think you do have a face that could look feminine.

Not because cis passing is impossible for you - in fact I think your face would eventually adjust very well with hormones - but transition is a long and difficult process that requires support to have a high chance of success.  I'm a similar size as you and struggled with the same things, and today I'm fortunate to be passing but also surrounded by lovely people I wouldn't need to be passing to have the same relationships with.\n\nThe thing is, even if your puberty was relatively severe compared to other trans women.. you're still trans, and it's not a problem that's going to go away without addressing it.  I tried addressing it for a bit when I was your age, then I tried not addressing it because I had the same concerns as you, and next thing I knew I ended up at rock bottom at the age of 30 with gender dysphoria crushing my mind and body.  Four years of concerted effort later I'm in a great position, but I have something like CPTSD from what I put myself through.\n\nEven if you can't find or make the economic and social support you need for transition for years, using hormones in the mean time goes a long way towards making eventual transition easier.  But do seek trans-positive friends, community, and workplace, because having that kind of support makes transition so, so much easier."}, {"author": "CaptainKernelCorn", "body": "Hey, afaik there's not much in terms of procedures that can be done at 15/16  If your parents are consenting you can start testosterone blockers and estrogen. I have no clue how your parents will react but if they are ok with it you can begin that. If they're ok with it I'd suggest starting it as soon as you're sure.\n\nYour face and body honestly to me looks like it'll pass with a bit of hrt. I don't think it's anything to worry about.

My voice is the best part of my transition as it stands now, so I'm quite happy to help!\\^\\^  \nFinally, as for height, some people like tall girls. I mean, if anything I'm a little jealous of you.

Will transitioning be physically safe? If the answer is yes to both, you should transition.\n\nFirst of all, I think you're too worried about your face. It looks fine. You can train your voice, too. It takes a little while but it works. You can always get surgery if you need to.\n\nHeight you can't do that much about, but it's also not a very big problem, not as much as you're worrying. You said .05%, that's one in every 2000 women. That's really not so bad. I probably see that many in a week. There's gonna be some tall people out there. It's not unheard of.\n\nMoreover, even if you can never transition to the point that you're happy with, I promise you will be much happier than if you just stayed the way you are. People seeing you as a trans woman is better than seeing you as a man, at least socially (unless you're at serious risk of hate crimes).\n\nYou are a teen now. Fucking do it. You can't wait for more permanent changes just because you're scared. It's scary, but worth it. Talk to a therapist or specialist if you can, as soon as possible.

Most people in daily life don't see your genitals.\n\nBut second, holy hell yes. I can't tell you how worth it it has been. I am myself, for the first time in my life. I love my body, I can feel my emotions, I have *boobs*, my relationships feel more authentic and real... transition has improved every part of my life. I have gone through some *shit* in the last few years, only some of it trans-related, but being myself has kept me centered and grounded in a way that very little ever has.

You are not alone!\n\nI'm 30, married and have a son. I have struggled with the similar high school experience of envying pretty girls. It was made worse when I met my gay friend at a young age. We played truth or dare once and being me, I only take dares because it's just more fun. Anyway, he dared me to lick his genitals and I did. Everything changed after that. We spent the night at his house every single night for years and my parents just thought it was normal because we played video games a lot. But during that time, I found I enjoy both men and women. I didn't know transgender was a thing back then. I didn't know about hormones and I was so afraid of telling anyone, I never sought help. So I met my girlfriend and now my wife. I never had an issue being a man in a relationship with a woman until a few years ago my dysphoria hit me so hard. I told her about it and it went horribly bad. I thought she would love the idea because she is such a big advocate of LGBTQ. But she said she supports me if I wanted to transition, but she would divorce me. Only because it's not what she wanted out of life and she wasn't attracted to women. So I stayed silent. I hid it. Then we had my son and the panic flared up again. Now I buy women's clothing and dress in secret but I've never been able to explore my feminine side outside my home. Now it affects me and my relationships because I'm so stressed with and depressed by how I feel. I'm so afraid to even see a therapist because my wife would know why I was going.\n\nAnyway, it sounds like you and I share the same issues with finding ourselves.

I think the idea that she was always trans is valid. It feels valid, *now*. But until someone comes out, saying they are trans feels not...good? \n\nThe comments that brought it on was talking about not being attracted to men and now they are relieved that they never have been. The relief comment feels very bi negative, but I can kind of write it off as expressing their own (unconscious prejudice or otherwise) feelings. My bigger issue is one where I am feeling offended on behalf of other people quite a bit, which I'm only concerned with working out for myself. Especially in this community (I originally typed this up on the /r/egg_irl sub) I have a problem with like a perceived pre-annihilation that I am experiencing. Like I currently identify as male and am AMAB. I feel I would want this current identity respected even if I later realized how hard it was and how much suffering it caused identifying as male. Right now I feel cis, and my gender isn't causing my problems, but it's like does water know it's wet. If I ever did transition I feel I wouldn't like my feelings and choices from now being disregarded by society because of new social norms. I worry about normalizing the idea that it's okay for people to erase another identity without a persons permission, but I realize it's also wrong in ways to acknowledge another identity without permission. Abigail said to treat her previous videos as another character 'The Man Who Isn't There', and it feels like they are treating the *character* as a woman not just trans. She was probably just explaining how to treat the videos that she wanted to leave up, so I don't think I can extrapolate her views or beliefs from that. But it feels like she explains it in the narrative that it's this way for her real life too. She was always playing the *character* and it was 'The *Man* Who Isn't There'.\n\nI think I have a separate but adjacent issue. I feel like I'm seeing a lot of people now expressing certainty that Abigail was always trans. And it doesn't feel like people saying \"I knew it\" when a guess or feeling they had comes true. It feels very disrespectful to feel anything about anybody with certainty. Saying before that Abigail could be trans is totally fine, but I'm having a problem respectfully saying that somebody is even probably trans, might be feels preferable almost every time. I didn't even feel comfortable writing every time there. I wonder (worry) if some of this is a subconscious feeling that being trans is not okay or something like that. But it feels like implying that you don't know your own mind. Or maybe insulting the process of figuring out your own mind.  \n\nI find resolving these feelings are one of the greatest reliefs I get from channels like PhilosophyTube and Contrapoints. Not because they explain the philosophy of being trans, but because they explain the philosophy of why it is right to be trans if you feel trans. And specifically why opposing viewpoints don't hold up to scrutiny. Abigail touches on my issues on previous identity in the video, but...I'm not quite there.  \n\nI'm pretty easy to convince, and am here in absolute good faith, appreciate any input because even when I disagree it usually makes how/why I feel more clear to me. And in turn would make it easier to communicate. Let me know if anybody has any tips for if/how I should make this it's own post, I find it much easier to do this sort of thing in comments. Making a post is like shining a spotlight on me and I'm not a fan.

Basically,  our brains developed differently in the womb compared to people of our AGAB. Per a study i dont have on hand right now, transgender people's brains show a difference even when controlled for sexual orientation and depression. This difference is the part that determines one's \"expected body image\".\n\nThis body image is less about weight, looking pretty or anything cultural. It is about sensations and expectations. As a transgender woman with primarily physical dysphoria/euphoria,  my brain expects female primary and secondary sex characteristics and also female endocrine levels. When the communication between my body and brain result in my brain realizing i have xy typical primary and secondary sex characteristics, i feel distress. Others may grow numb to this distress and instead end up feeling euphoria when those conflicts are repaired. \n\nSince this part of gender comes from biological things, it cannot be abolished. For most people, this matches their agab. Even for some transpeople. You also cannot really speak of this in a vacuum, only as \"my brain makes me feel uncomfortable with how my body developed in puberty, and this has nothing to do with culture.\"\n\nLiken it to phantom limbs. Someone who lost an arm but their brain expects an arm and thus causes aching where there is nothing.\n\n\n\n\nThe other half of gender is cultural gender. Basically, this is what we use to label a set of primary and secondary sex characteristics. In some cultures, we also use this to create overarching labels of: fertility, sexual attraction, sex characteristics, gender expression, gender roles.\n\nin modern western society, we only use social gender to label sex characteristics and to police behaviour based on those characteristics.\n\nPeople who are unhappy with these labels or the way their behaviour is policed MAY be transgender people, but may also sinply be gender non-conforming.\n\nNot all transgender people who experience a need to adapt their apparent sex to match their brain's expectations feel social gender dysphoria/euphoria. You can have a gender non-conforming transgender woman who wears flannels, has shaved head, builds muscle and cuts trees for instance. She will still be a woman, just not conforming with society's demands of women.\n\nHowever, you can also have transgender people who feel no need to change their apparent sex, and their e tire identity is based around modern wedtern gender labels and feeling discomfort or euphoria as a consequence.\n\nThese people are valid and transgender.\n\nHowever, i will concede that should we abolish gender (that is: eliminate gender roles and stop policing behaviour and expression), this form of being transgender might also vanish.\n\n\n\nTldr: abolishing gender does not go against being trans. \n\nIt is either irrelevant (physical dysphoria/euphoria)\n\nor ideal (social dysphoria/euphoria)"}, {"author": "acopicshrewdness", "body": "Tell them to watch JK Rowling by Contrapoints."}, {"author": "JollyGanache", "body": "I don't have the greatest resources offhand (although I will say you might wanna consider video essays if your friend has the patience to watch them, I think seeing someone speak and move can help people empathize more than text they can project tone onto), but I will just say this: I wish you the absolute best of luck, but also remember that there is no piece of information good enough to \"make\" someone change their beliefs unless they're open to it on their own terms.

She has also directly caused or contributed to the harassment of other trans people online. Her complaints of being harassed online (in ways which cannot substantially hurt her because she can easily afford to protect herself) are really disingenuous compared to how she\u2019s used her platform to cause other trans people who are poor, non-white, disabled, and generally in no way her financial or social peers to be harassed in life-altering (and at times life-threatening) ways, and with the high profile of her videos, that exposure isn\u2019t just to her fans/trans people and allies, but to huge numbers of people wanting to harass us. \n\nHere\u2019s a  good twitter thread related to her most recent video on JKR. https://twitter.com/Nymphomachy/status/1354254200100687873?s=20\n\nAnd here\u2019s a thread from one of the trans people she harassed: https://twitter.com/ifeelthewind/status/1259724955626938368?s=20 \n\nHere\u2019s one of her own statements, where she throws nonbinary people (who are on the whole FAR more marginalized than she will ever be) under the bus because it slightly inconveniences her as a cis-passing binary woman to be asked her pronouns \ud83d\ude44 https://www.pride.com/sites/www.pride.com/files/contratweets.jpg .

I've looked through it and agree with some of your points and not others, so let's go through them! Also these are my opinions and I haven't watched Contra very long or know much about her, so please feel free to refute my arguments with your own. This is a long one so buckle in <3\n\nFirst on being exclusionary to nonbinary people and the last thread you posted; I haven't seen all of her videos, and haven't really seen her talk about non-binary people positively or negatively on youtube. The only time I saw her mention it was when she was explaining that she thought she was nonbinary for a time before figuring out she was trans. I will watch her video on pronouns and see what I think. While it would be nice to see more representation and discussion of nonbinary people in her videos, I also haven't seen anything negative, and she has expressed in her videos that she doesn't like to always talk about the struggles of other lgbtq groups that she hasn't experienced such as trans men, as she might have similar struggles, but not always they same. As for the last tweet, I think that is a bad opinion and she is wrong for thinking that, but I can see why she might think that (not saying it's right). Passing is obviously very important to her, and in today's society, a group of cis women are not going to go around asking each others pronouns in most cases. She seems to feel like she passes less when she's in a group and they start asking pronouns (presumably because they clock her for not passing). Whether we should integrate asking pronouns into everyday life, I'll let you decide, but the fact is it ISN'T something most people do or experience every day with everyone they meet. It makes her feel like less of a women to be asked her pronouns. However, I do think she makes it very selfish and self centered by trying to blame non-binary people for more and more people asking pronouns, which is just not fair because it is VERY important to non-binary people, and even other trans people. I definitely don't like this opinion, but also this tweet was a year ago and maybe her opinion has changed I'm not sure.\n\nI don't want comment on the second Twitter thread as I'm not sure what video that is in reference to, so I'd rather not form opinions based on one side. Also, Contra is obviously very rich, very white, and cis-passing, so I would agree a lot of her view points or inhibited by this, but also I have heard her in her videos bring up the struggles of trans people who aren't rich or white. It's not something she talks about that often, but she doesn't have the same experiences as someone who is poor and not white,, so I think it's better for her to talk about shared experiences between different class and race trans people, which, I would say, most of her videos do. \n\nLastly, I will say I disagree with most of the first twitter thread, although there are some good points. I think she probably doesn't know how JK Rowling feels, whether she's lonely or isolated because of her wealth. It does sound like she might be projecting some of her insecurities into her view of Joanne. But I do think it can be lonely at the top, more than people realize, even if she isn't an \"internet celebrity\" like Contra. Also I don't fault Contra for trying to sympathies or understand JK Rowling. In fact, I think it's the best way to try and change peoples opinion. It's the same reason I'm on some TERF and Conservative subreddits on another account. I don't post, I don't comment, and I fucking hate these people, but to better refute people arguments, it can help to try and sympathize with them, or at least try and figure out WHY they might have those views. I don't blame the thread for being unhappy with Contra saying she thinks JK Rowling is probably a good person. I don't think JK Rowling is a good person, but I also don't think she's evil, I think she's ignorant. But that's just my opinion and everyone has a different moral compass, doesn't mean one way is right or wrong. I think the thing I disliked most about this thread is she's obviously viewing Contra with a SUPER biased view, and not objectively at all. She wrote her opinions on the thread while watching the video, not even watching the whole thing to better understand Contra's opinion and quite obviously went in LOOKING for things to say are wrong about the video. She even states in one of the later tweets in the thread, she's only 5 minutes in, which I find absolutely ridiculous that she's forming so many opinions and all negative while being 5 minutes into the video, obviously coming in looking for things to hate. I would consider myself at least somewhat objective as I've only watched Contra for a few weeks and don't have a solid opinion one way or another of her. I've seen somethings she's said I agree with and some I don't, but I don't think this thread on JK Rowling video is very good or objective imo.\n\nAnyways sorry for writing so much.

If you find her videos informative, or rhetorically useful when you\u2019re communicating with others about those topics, im glad. I think it helps to engage with that understanding Natalie\u2019s own biases and fuckups also, though. Personally, the kind of content she makes isn\u2019t for me, so I don\u2019t feel very personally invested, but i do find it to be a really frustrating pattern that a trans person gets some financial success and social capital and then openly shits on trans people whose experiences they don\u2019t personally relate to when they always have the option to not say anything, y\u2019know?

If she really is attacking people on Twitter, that is super contradictory to her videos. She openly states in a lot of her videos that her opinions are not the opinions of all trans people and she doesn't want to be the ambassador for the opinion of all trans people. She even talks about in the \"Gender Critical\" video how she isn't in the world 1% but the 1% of trans folks, so it has been easier for her to pass, and she's never really experienced being called a monster or \"it\" because she passes so well because surgery and money. The only time I've heard her talk bad about some trans people, is when she's criticizing trans people that hate on other trans with different opinions (like how she knows a lot of trans people feel like they were a woman trapped in a man's body, but she feels like she was a man, and now she's a woman).

In general, you're going to have to sort out your gender stuff before you can really tell about your sexuality. When your body is wrong, you just get wrong answers when you consider your sexuality. You should just \"want what you want when you want it\", and you can sort out the labels later. In specific, you're already ideating, so we'll come back to sexuality.\n\nAll that said\u2026 The usual test is a \"button question\". This doesn't always involve a button per se.\n\nImagine a well-meaning genie decides you're trans. You wake up on a lazy saturday, in a woman's body \u2014 but more than that, the magic has changed your photos, your IDs, other people's memories, etc. It's like suddenly you were always female. Your wardrobe is all from the women's section. Your friends and family call you by a girl's name, the same one that's now on your driver's license. Your parents remember that first \"It's a girl!\", they remember you being a girl every time they changed your diapers, your mom remembers teaching you period stuff when you went through puberty, etc.\n\nWould this be turning you into a trans man, transitioning to reclaim some or all of your maleness? Would you thank the genie and live happy as a woman?\n\nNow, fast-forwards to after the pandemic is over. You've been female for months. The bars are reopening, and your friends are taking you out to a \"bi bar\"; all genders and sexualities and whatever combinations are welcome to mingle and flirt. You put on a nice dress(one that was already in your wardrobe), you get all dolled up(you've had months to practice makeup), and you go with them. Some people are clearly female, some people are clearly male, some people aren't wearing their gender on their sleeve. You turn heads. You catch flirty looks from women and men and some you'd have to ask to tell; they range from very feminine to very masculine, with quite a few steps in between.\n\nWho interests you? Whose flirty glances do you reply to with your own? Which combinations do you want close to your female body?\n\nMaybe you're a lesbian. Maybe you're a straight girl. Maybe you're a bi girl. Maybe you're an asexual girl, and it's hard to tell which way the arrow points because it doesn't point. Maybe you can tell you should be female, and once that's fixed you can start browsing the bi bar. They say being LGBT is having teen experiences in your 20s and 30s \u2014 maybe your 30s will be when you go through puberty(but the right one this time) and then start figuring out who you're into."}, {"author": "TwoCanPlayBeyblade", "body": "You sound trans."}, {"author": "Wylecard", "body": "It sounds like you're questioning your gender and sexuality. \n\nYou've actively explored your interest towards men and there wasn't anything there.

This is going to be a long write up. \n\nI'm a bi transwoman who was engaged to a straight cis woman before I came out as trans. She knew I was trans before we started dating, but I did not start transition until after we were together. I don't think she really appreciated what that would entail. Due to distance, and sexuality, we opened and closed our relationship a few times before our relationship fell apart. Here were the issues:\n\n* Sex tapered off way faster than either of us thought it would. She was not attracted to me as soon as the first changes of estrogen began to hit, and I was so put off by her disdain for my body that I no longer found it enjoyable to even attempt to keep things physical. \n\n* The loss of sexual intimacy unwound other positive aspects of our relationship. \n\n* The openness of our relationship was negotiated to heavily favor her. She wanted to be intimate with a man, but I was only allowed women (kind of a reverse One Penis Policy\u2122). \n\n* I fell heavily for the first people that validated my feminine identity (a lesbian triad), which broke our open relationship rule of being intimate but not romantic with others.  \n\n* As time went on, and I explored my queer identity, she still stayed the same while I was changing a lot. I also began to pick up a lot of the bad habits of the folks I was romantically involved with. Even on a platonic level my ex and I were no longer compatible. \n\nCould it work out in a different relationship? Sure. Would I have done anything differently? Yeah, likely drank less tequila in 2018, otherwise no. I wish I would have ended the relationship sooner, as then I could have explored being me without all the burden of having to tiptoe around someone who was never going to accept me anyways. I used to scoff when people told me that breaking up was the healthiest thing a trans person could do when in a relationship with a cis/het person before starting transition, but I totally get it now.

For me specifically, my trans identity is very strongly associated with my existence I guess and I found out last year I've been a female my whole life and had no idea before that, I had signs but not specifically gender, long story short everything \"clicked\".  \n\nI had this \"urgent\" sense of coming out and I told my parents 2 days after I realized and it just felt like I had to do it.  It's happened again with certain friends, I've felt the need to tell them and did it. I've realized it directly affects my depression and sense of self acceptance and well being the more I come out throughout transition.  Unfortunately coming out for me has been through various stages and it never seems to end, there is always another specific one that needs to be done.  The good thing is when I need to do it, it goes smoothly and at that point the fear and doubts are gone.   I'm ready to come out at work now and feel the NEED to do it asap so I'm now ready to do it. Ive realized if I don't act on these needs that I feel, I start thinking things like \"am I ever gonna be me\" or \"make it to the end goal of looking like how I feel\"...and the coming out certainly helps move forward for me as I've felt more confident about myself. \n\nI  don't care what people think at the end of the day(so ironic, let's not get into that one ha), but I think it has more to do with your self and dealing with the transition and self identity.  I think it makes it more real and the urgency and need you feel is maybe because this is you and you want people to know, it's hard to be around others in a \"fake\" capacity and I feel like you get tired of that environment at some point and that has something to do as well.  I don't think it has anything to do with seeking validation from others either, it's more like self acceptance, at least for me :)\n\nThat feeling of obligation and need stem from some fear for me.  Usually if think about the reasons around that specific coming out, then I recognize and identify the issues around it.  For example, coming out at work for me is big in that the word would start spreading and my close family knows, but the rest of my extended family and friends don't, and they all live driving distance!

Some people try to say things like, \"Yeah, we all feel that way sometimes, that doesn't mean you are a girl/boy.\" This kind of thing comes up a lot when surgeries are discussed with friends and family. They will say everyone feels bad about their body sometimes, and you should learn to live with it like everyone else. Surgery is scary, so I understand that it often comes from a place of being worried about our safety. Most of us who opt for surgery, though, know the risks and decide it's worth it. It just makes things harder when people aren't supportive about it.\n\nAside from that, though, I think it's great that you can empathize with trans people. If you are a woman and feel distress sometimes because you think your body looks too male, that likely is similar to the gender dysphoria that trans people feel. It may be less intense, because you likely have an inate sense that you are undeniably a woman, and so it probably doesn't make you spiral into being depressed about every aspect of your life... but that doesn't invalidate your experience.\n\nIf you are ever having a conversation with a trans person, though. I would recommend not saying something like, \"Oh, I totally get it. I have felt something similar.\" That probably wouldn't go over too well.

I feel like most laypeople don't understand the mechanics of what's going on and are simply going off what the talking heads, celebrities, and politicians are saying. There's been a lot of misinformation spread about this event and obviously some pro traders on /r/wallstreetbets are taking advantage of vulnerable people by encouraging them to dump money into this by portraying the act of buying GameStop stock like it's some glorious revolution against Wall Street when everyone's just looking for a quick buck. It will not end well. \n\nThis is not a revolution. Some traders saw an opportunity to band together and squeeze a few short hedge funds out of existence because they saw that they were dangerously overshort on GameStop stock. Those hedge funds probably did not do anything wrong per se to be demonized the way they were but just got caught on the wrong side of a bad trade and got outsmarted.\n\nIs the system not ideal? Yes. But we are all stuck with it.

Share owners lose enough interest that price falls enough for those shorts to be profitable (hedge funds win), or enough shareholders hold and force hedge funds to cover at high price, which would likely lead to a short squeeze.\n\nSo, what are the pressures against either side?  Against the shareholders, theres concern others won't hold long enough to force the squeeze.  Theres also the possibility that market manipulation tactics, already *extremely* brazen, transparent, and arguably illegal, become even more so, leading shareholders to believe that the suits simply won't *allow* them to win no matter the technical justificaion of the trade.  Theres also just... boredom.

It is not possible to embody love and simultaneously speak in terms of condemnation, prohibition, and fear of punishment.\n\nLike you I was raised Christian (though not as strictly) and have found solace in other traditions.  I gave up animal products and pursued a life of non-harm long before I fully understood myself to be transgender.\n\nIn hindsight, one moment precipitating my self-acceptance and eventual transition happened when I was in my garden, watching a mosquito bite my ankle, half-meditating on the nature of harm and the differences between necessity, negligence, and malice.  A mosquito bites to feed, they are a part of creation and therefor a part of love.  We do not understand what consciousness they experience and have no tools by which to teach them, so it is wrong, in my heart, to put their life beneath my comfort.\n\nBut a person is not a mosquito; we have been given tools to learn and express ourselves.  When a person does me harm because of ignorance, they do not do so out of necessity.  My self-denial in that circumstance helps nobody, it only deepens our pain and distances us from love.  Therefore it is better to make a transphobic person uncomfortable, confused, angry, than to be silent when they mistreat me and others.  It is not my speaking out that causes their discomfort, it is their own distance from love, and they will never find love if they remain ignorant to the harm they cause.\n\nI also reaffirmed in that moment that my love of the world must be rooted in a love for the life I was given.  It is not selfish to do so; if anything it is selfish to live in self-imposed restriction, pain and self-pity, and it is un-Dharmic to deny my identity as a transgender person.\n\nSo in many ways my faith, or the loose amalgamations of thought I call my faith, has helped me tremendously with accepting myself and eventually transitioning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS Not sure if this helps in any way, but I don't consider veg/vegan diets to be restrictive.  I eat as many animals, and squash as many mosquitos as I want to!  It happens that that number is *zero*.

Wanting more things. They're going to have an unrealistic ideal for your body--if HRT diminishes your erection capabilities you're going to instantly become useless to them, do recognize this. They aren't treating you like a  a friend or a lover or even really a human, they're treating you like a disembodied feminine penis, and the moment it doesn't do what they want it to do you *will* become essentially obsolete. They'll either ask you to take erection meds, or they'll tell you something like \"ooh, sorry, but you're...not capable of being what we need anymore\".\n\nJust remember that you're being fetishized by these people. The wife's \"hope that you enjoyed yourself\" are the same feelings that every john gets after they've used the services of a prostitute, they want to delude themselves into thinking that the pro is doing this because they truly want to and not because they were paid money.\n\nPersonally I think that continuing to have sex with them long term can cause a host of issues, I've seen so many unhealthy attachment issues come from even repeat clients of \"established\" sex workers in my social circle, and their taking advantage of the fact that you aren't a professional sex worker in and of itself just sets off red blaring klaxon alarms.

If you consider the inverse then, a presentation/performance of masculinity doesn't become more or less valid based on the identity of the person performing it.\n\nAs a fellow trans person I can totally relate to the feelings you've expressed. It's weird and will take some time to work through those feelings. The closest analogy I can think of right now would be seeing a fictional performance and being really invested in a character/performance only to find out that the actor embodies completely different traits off screen.

So the same asshats who used to claim the homosexuals were coming to recruit your children and destroy the family(tm)/church/America/the world, just replaced \"gay\" with \"trans\" and are recycling the same old arguments. It's a very effective way to rile up their \"values voters\" constituents - we're the evil invisible invading menace, we're the reason their lives suck, we're a threat to everything they know and love, and the Good Godly Republicans promise to destroy the scary trans monster if the voters will just put them in power.\n\nAnd now they're *not* in power, so they're flailing. We're an easy target. \n\nAnd the social changes we've seen over the last few years have them freaking out. A lot of things they once thought were impossible - treatment for trans youth, anti-discrimination laws, ability to update legal ID, insurance coverage for transition-related care, growing social acceptance, etc - are now either reality or at least possible in much of the US. So we get a huge wave of backlash.\n\nIt all feels so similar to the anti-gay backlash in the late 90's/early 2000's. Even the arguments are the same. As public discussion about \"domestic partnerships\" and anti-discrimination laws started to get more serious, as more people started coming out younger and more publicly than ever before, as state laws started to change, the anti-gay asshats went apeshit. They saw the writing on the wall, they knew that \"sodomy\" laws were going to be struck down and marriage equality was coming, so they started throwing everything they had into trying to stop it."}, {"author": "-Jess_Me-", "body": "I live in a fairly liberal area and last week I was verbally accosted while at the filling station.

The OP i believe is referring to vulnerability triggered in transphobes by the change of government in the US and Biden has indeed said some positive things. I am hoping they may help temper the damage done in the UK, because the legal systems of common law countries do sometimes take precedent from one another. Unfortunately not so much in the UK, but places like Australia, unlike the UK, do sometimes look to the US for legal precedent.\n\nTERF culture is indeed a serious problem. I totally agree with you about the UK, it's quite a different situation at the moment and i am still reeling from the appalling decision of the Bell vs. Travistock case. That was clearly backed by some powerful TERF money. \n\nUnfortunately this kind of thing threatens trans children in all common law countries, like the US and my former homeland. Thankfully Germany, my home, has an inquisitorial legal system and is much harder prey for things like some of the TERF action that has taken place in the UK and i believe trans people, especially children, are much safer here. But Bell vs. Travistock is a threat to all the wonderful work for example done by the cases Re: Jamie and Re: Kelvin in Australia. We've just had a sad step backwards there last year with Re: Imogen: not quite as bad as the UK case, but it still puts a huge hurdle in the face of children whose parents do not agree on treatment. And of course trans children whose parents are unsupportive are completely vulnerable everywhere.\n\nSo i am indeed watching the UK with trepidation. \n\nI couldn't believe the hypocrisy of the medical treatment of the cohort of trans children being decided in the adversarial court system in Bell vs. Travistock at the same time the corona virus vaccine was being rolled out.\n\nNormally medical treatment is decided by sound statistical assessment of risk vs. benefits. Thus the general public get the benefit of an assessment that recognizes anaphylaxis risk but continues general treatment because statistical analysis shows the size of the risk accurately. In Bell vs. Travistock, we have the treatment of tens of thousands of trans children being decided on a self-selected statistical sample of one case that went wrong and the mother who wants to block her child, and the assessment of the \"sample\" was done adversarially without a scrap of epidemiological or statistical analysis to be seen anywhere. \n\nThe general public get the benefit of the scientific method whilst trans children in the UK just suck it up.\n\nAustralian children have had it better, and, although there are some outstanding treatment facilities there, i suspect a bit of a conspiracy to keep them underfunded, because waiting lists keep blowing out appallingly."}, {"author": "IAmAWalrusBroski", "body": "No need to be sorry for me, i'm not being personally attacked.

Some people may not place too much value in them, some people may even enjoy actively rejecting them, but most people will feel comfortable expressing their own gender in a way that they think they are supposed to.

If trans-people have such feelings, we call them \"gender dysphoria\".

Gender dysphoria is feeling invalid or insufficient in your own body and gender expression.  \n\nIt can express itself as a range of symptoms.

Because ultimately they need to change things about themselves to fix it. The best you can do is validate people and make them feel seen as who they really are. You can also help with the symptoms, by providing emotional support or distraction.  \n\nSeeing someone you care about deal with dysphoria can be heartbreaking.

It's easier to fight hate crimes and violence, you can clearly point to it and say \"this is wrong and that person is evil.\" In institutional settings people like to hide behind \"policies\" and \"procedures\" to pretend that they aren't being transphobic and try to make you feel like you're the one overreacting when you call it out. You will need to learn to become assertive if you are not already. And remember that you are not wrong or crazy for pointing out the issue. If the person is genuinely trying, they will make an attempt to fix the issue as best they can, not just try to say they can't do anything. Transphobes don't like trans people, and they hate trans people who stand up for themselves even more, so it may be a battle sometimes. My advice is to find places that are supportive as best as you can. Find medical providers that respect you for being trans and understand your healthcare needs. Seek out workplaces with supportive supervisors, as this will make all the difference in how workplace issues go. I am upfront in interviews about being trans. If you can get supportive people in your corner, it makes all the difference.

I'm non binary, white, go by he/him pronouns - but don't pass. I've been asked if I was in the right bathroom, which has the potential to become dangerous. I've been to bars where i've had weird interactions.

Black trans women are much more likely to face violence, for example.\n2. It depends a lot on your immediate social network. If your family is anywhere from confused to supportive, this helps tremendously. If your family is actively hostile and your friends abandon you, you are tremendously more vulnerable. I was fortunate enough to have an almost entirely supportive family.\n3. Social danger is acute, not chronic. Even if I were in a much less tolerant place, 99% of people literally can't be bothered to harass and threaten someone because they've got other stuff to do, because confrontations are potentially risky, and because most people just don't care enough. But the difference between 1% of people harassing and threatening you and 0.01% of people, psychologically, is absolutely massive. It's the difference between knowing there is a realistic chance you will be in danger on any given day (even though it's not likely!) and those situations being unlikely enough that we don't bother to plan for them. \n\nSo yeah. It's worth keeping perspective about what people are talking about when they talk about abuse and harassment received because they are trans: it's not like every day is an action movie, but rather a climate of fear created by largely indifferent and occasionally hostile interactions.

It SUCKS too and is so confusing but do what you can to give yourself space and especially to talk to as many trans people irl as you can. As helpful as reddit has been for me, talking to people in real time has been the most helpful. \n\nFwiw, everything you're describing vibes with a lot of my experiences and sounds pretty trans. \n\nThe last thing I'll say is that the road to self-acceptance can be really tough because you have to mediate so many different external and internal factors. That's where gender specialists are incredibly helpful. \n\nOne of the hardest parts of being trans is being put in a position where you feel like you need to \"justify\" your existence both to others and yourself. It's bullshit and sucks but I think we are often fighting through that before we're even confronting dysphoria itself\n\nI think you know this, Jess, but I'll say it anyway: only you can say if you are or are not trans, but what's more important in some ways is your ability to want and believe that you can be trans and moreover, *happy* and yourself and a *full human being.*\n\nLike in the Matrix, Neo is told again and again he is the one, but it's not until he chooses to believe that he's the one that he can actually exist as the one. Go back and watch that movie and you'll almost go crazy seeing how many times Neo is confronted with the truth but still can't accept it. That's what it's like and there's a reason it was written by two trans women. As maddening as it is though, Neo ultimately has to confront the obstacles in himself and his own beliefs before he can move on. He has to want it, but moreover he has to learn to *let himself* want it, *then* to go *be* it. And it's also worth noting that there is also an extent to which he just has to take a leap of faith and go for it. I mean the movie makes this very literal also in the roof jumping scene.

Identifying oneself as \"trans...\" is usually just for the trans person themselves to do whenever they feel an appropriate need to do so, and it's usually kinda weird seeming if a cis person in your life is *always* only referring to you as \"trans man\" or \"trans woman\" rather than just as \"a man\" or \"a woman\". \n\nSome trans people feel a certain sort of connection with the identity of being trans, and may use this moniker for themselves most of the time. But others don't feel that same sort of way, and will only refer to themselves as trans when it is relevant. Like some people might put in their insta bio \"trans man\" or \"ftm\", but others don't do this (though they may still put their pronouns, but this doesn't denote someone as being trans specifically, as plenty of cis people also put their pronouns...just knowing someone's pronouns doesn't also mean that you know whether or not they identify as their AGAB or as a different gender). I think other sorts of identities are sort of similar, some people might put something in their bio like \"lesbian\" or \"gay af\" or something (but I don't think it's as common as trans people listing that they are trans), while other people choose not to put that sort of info.\n\nThere are also some instances where someone may need to be constantly telling others in person/new people they meet \"I'm a trans man\" or \"I'm a trans woman\" in order to have those other people know what pronouns they use, or know what gender to view them as. If someone is pre or non medical transition they may need to do this, and/or if someone finds they don't pass enough to strangers/new people to have them auto know how to gender them. So it's something some may feel a need to do in order to get gendered correctly/in order to help avoid being misgendered. If they reach a point where they find they are passing consistently and aren't being misgendered by new people or strangers, then many trans people will stop outing themselves and only offer that information when they feel it is relevant to do so. While others may continue to put that information about themselves out there. \n\nIt's just different from person to person. In my every day life I just refer to myself as a guy. If I feel I am in a safe environment/group of people, then I will ask for they/them pronouns over he/him, and let people know I identify more so as trans masc rather than strictly binary masc. And when I am around other trans people or meet other trans people I will likely share that I am trans as well to them so that we know there are topics we can talk about and relate to each other about, and so that we can hopefully feel safer talking about trans stuff to the other person if we want to. Unless something about my medical or physical transition is relevant I don't usually straight up tell doctors \"I'm trans\", but I will still list hrt on the paperwork in the section for what medications I'm on, and will list my surgeries if the paperwork asks for past surgeries. Sometimes doctors don't say anything about these things, sometimes they ask about them. If they ask about them directly, like \"why are you on testosterone?\" then I tell them I'm transitioning (since to them I just look like a guy, and I am quite young, and it's not that common for cis guys who are young to need a T medication, it's more common for older folks, so they might think I have some kind of condition and feel a need to ask why I'm on it...even if I do find it to still feel/be kind of intrusive that they ask lol). Usually on dating apps I will put in my bio that I'm trans/nb, but if people act too weird to me about it on whatever the site/app is, then I might take that piece of info down (really the only place where people cared or acted weird about it was grindr lol, I mostly have used okcupid and now facebook dating, and no one on either has ever cared, and it's nice to be able to be like \"aye me too!\" when you come across someone else who also has that info in their profile lol). If I meet someone irl I generally don't tell them in the first meeting that I'm trans. If we start heading in a relationship direction, where it is clear and known to both of us like \"we are going to go on dates now\" or whatever, then I will tell them, cos if they're not into it I'd rather them have the chance to politely walk away early on, rather than let more time pass for them to grow attached and thus more possibility of them acting harsher if/when I tell them. (But that is just my own personal take on sharing that I'm trans when it comes to relationships. Every trans person is different and has their own preference and tactic for that sort of thing.)

There are some aspects of my dysphoria (body hair being one of biggest ones) that have always been present to some degree. Other aspects of my dysphoria relate to my sense of \"fitting in\" with the parts of society that my identity most meshes with. The best example of this second category is my height which was one of the first things I struggled with when first accepting that I am trans. In my eyes (or rather the eyes of my anxiety) I'm right on the edge of too tall, but this has only been my perception much more recently. Before truly accepting my identity, I tried to lean into what i perceived as the things that would make me fit in with the fact that I was amab such as growing out my beard and being more \"athletic.\" At this point in my life I felt like I was too short, because when compared to most of the men in my family I was anywhere from like 2 inches shorter to 3 and 5 inches shorter than my brother and cousin respectively.\n\nComing to terms with these differing image issues has been bizarre, especially as I discover new ways in which I feel like my identity doesn't belong to me. The good thing about these more perceptive aspects of dysphoria however is the fact that as I get a better understanding of my identity, they are reframed.
